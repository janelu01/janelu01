Hi, Iâ€™m Jane!

I am passionate about content design and using plain language to make information accessible and easy to understand. I'm always looking to learn more about how to write clear documentation and guidance.

I graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Arts, English RMPC with specialization in Digital Media Studies, from the University of Waterloo in 2021.
